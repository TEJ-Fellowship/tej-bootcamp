<details><summary><h3 style="display:inline">Chapters</h3></summary>
<details><summary>Part 6-a: Flux-architecture and Redux</summary>

- [Part 6-a: Flux-architecture and Redux](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part6/flux_architecture_and_redux)

**_WE-WILL-LEARN:_**

- create redux store
- pass the redux store to app via provider

**_LECTURE-VIDEO:_**

- [Create a counter app that uses redux](https://youtu.be/PwaIfWc0Idw)
  1. Setup the application
  - clone the [react starter repo](https://github.com/TEJ-Fellowship/react-start-kit)
  - rename to redux-counter
  - cd redux-counter
  - rm -rf .git
  - npm i redux
  2. Create a simple counter app using useState in index.js (we won't be using App.jsx yet)
  - create a reducer, `counterReducer` in this case. the reducer does the work similar to `setState`
  - create a store, by using `createStore` and passing it the reducer
  - use `store.getState()` to get the store (like the `state`)
  - use `store.dispatch(action)` to modify the store (like calling `setState`)
    - `action` is an object with `type` key, and optionally `data` key
  - use `store.subscribe(React Component)` to rerender component when store changes
- [Create a note app that uses redux](https://youtu.be/5ypUAitqbjQ)
  1. Setup the application
  - clone the [react starter repo](https://github.com/TEJ-Fellowship/react-start-kit)
  - rename to redux-note
  - cd redux-counter
  - rm -rf .git
  - npm i redux
  2. Setup redux in index.jsx for note app
  - create a reducer, `noteReducer` in this case. the reducer does the work similar to `setState`
  - create a store, by using `createStore` and passing it the reducer
  - use `store.getState()` to get the store (like the `state`)
  - use `store.dispatch(action)` to modify the store (like calling `setState`)
    - `action` is an object with `type` key, and `data` key
  - use `store.subscribe(React Component)` to rerender component when store changes
  3. Add functionality to toggle importance using Test Driven Development method
  - setup test environment
    - install required packages
    - configure .babelrc file
    - add test script to package.json
    - add jest environment to .eslintrc.json
    - add `deep-freeze` library to test for immutability
  - move the `noteReducer` to its own file at reducers/noteReducer.js
    - export store and the reducer
  - in the test file `noteReducer.test.js`, put test case for adding a new post
  - add another test to toggle the `important` field
- [Add functionality to add new note](https://youtu.be/y7WYvEL27-U)
  1. Add form to add note
  2. Add `onSubmit` handler that calls `store.dispatch` for adding note
  3. Add frontend for toggling
  - add `onClick` call to `toggleImportance` function from each note display
  - write the function `toggleImportance` to call `store.dispatch`
  4. Write action creators for adding note, and toggling importance
  - write an `action creator` called `toggleImportanceOf` that creates the action to dispatch for toggling importance
  - write an `action creator` called `createNote` that creates the action to dispatch for adding note
- [Refactor note app to use Provider](https://youtu.be/qezPIuply_M)
  1. Put the reducer in the `reducers/noteReducer.js` file
  2. Also move the action creators to `reducers/noteReducer.js`
  3. Move the app component to `App.js`
  4. npm install react-redux
  5. Modify the store related code in `index.js`, pass the store to `Provider` and wrap the `App` with it
  - in `index.js` import `Provider`
  - wrap `App` with `Provider` with `store`
  6. Modify `App` to read `store` from `Provider`
  - `useSelector` to get access to the `store`
  - `useDispatch` to get access to `dispatch`
  7. Now even if we refactor `add new note` form to its own component, we don't need to pass the store from App; the store can be directly accessed by all the components
  - refactor creating new note into its own component

  - note that `NewNote` and `Notes` components have been refactored from `App` component
  1. Initialize `notes` state with two notes in `noteReducer`
  2. Create visibility filter to show all / important notes
  - put radio buttons with `onChange` event handler
  - note that `name` is same for the `radio` inputs to form a `button group`
  - use `useState` to store the state of visibility in `App` component
  - pass the state as prop to `Notes`
  - in `Notes` use the prop to show the desired notes
  3. Create new reducer `filterReducer` to store value of filter
  - put the reducer function `filterReducer`
  - create action creator `filterChange`
  4. Modify index.js to combine the reducers `filterReducer` and `noteReducer`
  - import `combineReducers` from `redux`
  - use `combineReducers` to combine the two reducers
  - change `createStore` to take the combined reducer
  5. Change the code to use redux instead of useState
  - modify `Notes.js` to now only read the `notes` key from the state
  - dispatch to the reducer when radio button is clicked
  - modify `Notes.js` to use filter from redux store instead of useState
  6. Create separate component for `VisibilityFilter`
  - in `App` use the `VisibilityFilter` component to display the filter
- [Using Redux Toolkit](https://youtu.be/dzJeixwWD8A)
  1. Install the Redux Toolkit
  - npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
  2. Modify `index.js` to use toolkit
  - import and use `configureStore` to create store, which will replace `combineReducers` and `createStore`
  3. Modify `noteReducer.js` to use toolkit
  - use `createSlice` to refactor the reducer and action creators
  - use export using toolkit
  - how is `action.type` derived?
- [Using Redux devtool](https://youtu.be/kYXq0ajXHmI)
  1. Install devtool from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd
  - this only works if using Redux Toolkit
  2. Open the Redux devtool window

- Create a table called `notes`

```
CREATE TABLE notes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    content text NOT NULL,
    important boolean,
    date time
);
```

- Insert a row into `notes` table

```
insert into notes (content, important) values ('Relational databases rule the world', true);
```

- Read rows from `notes` table

```
select * from notes;
```

- Remove the table `notes`

```
drop table notes;
```

- Through table, and many-to-many relations
- Other sequelize functionalities

**_LECTURE-VIDEO:_**

- [Data migration the proper way](https://youtu.be/V10LVTJY1dA)
  1. Create the initial data migration script
  - create the file `migrations/20230929_00_initialize_notes_and_users.js`
  2. Write code to run migrations
  - npm install umzug
  - add migration code to `util/db.js`
  - remove the `sync` code from `models/index.js`
  3. Run the first migration
  - drop all existing tables
  - start the node server
- [Admin user and user disabling](https://youtu.be/y9e3rEGovpI)
  1. Create a user
  2. Create a few notes
  3. Stop the server
  4. Create migration file with new fields
  - create the file `migrations/20230929_01_admin_user_disabling.js`
  5. Make corresponding changes to `models/User`
  6. Start the server
  7. Make changes to loginRouter to disallow logging in for users with `disabled` field set to true
  8. Try logging in with disabled user
  - create a disabled user
  - using REST Client, try logging in with the disabled user vs. a not-disabled user
  9. Create route for admin user to change status of a user
  - make changes in `controllers/users`
  - move `tokenExtractor` from `controllers/notes` to `util/middleware.js`
  - import `tokenExtractor` in both `controllers/users` and `controllers/notes`
  10. Create admin user that can change disabled user to enabled user
  - convert user 1 to admin
  ```sql
  update users
  set admin=true
  where id=1;
  ```
  - login with user 1
  - use token from user 1 to update user 2 to enabled
  11. Create rollback functionality to undo migration
  - modify `util/db` to put rollback function
  - create `util/rollback.js` that calls the rollback function
  - add script in package.json to run the rollback file
- [Creating many-to-many relationship to allow users to be part of multiple teams](https://youtu.be/VzK0_efeKU0)
  1. Create migration for `teams` and `memberships` tables in file `migrations/20230929_02_add_teams_and_memberships.js`
  2. Make models form `Team` and `Membership` to reflect updated schema
  3. Update `models/index` to define the new relationships
  4. Create some teams
  5. Add users to teams in the membership table
  6. Now change get users route to include teams of the users, and excluding through table data
  7. Understand the object returned by sequelize such as in the code below:
  ```js
  const user = await User.findByPk(1, {
    include: {
      model: Note,
    },
  });
  user.notes.forEach((note) => {
    console.log(note.content);
  });
  ```
  8. Creating new return object when required shape is different from object returned by database
- [Revisiting many-to-many relationships](https://youtu.be/cSCbmTmdp2M)
  1. Create migration for `user_notes` through table to associate many users with many notes
  2. Create `userNote` model
  3. Modify `models/index` for the many to many relation
  4. Modify get users route to return users' notes and user marked notes
  5. In the route, add the author of the note
- [Concluding remarks](https://youtu.be/OJ6d18lIyPU)
  1. Lazy fetch based on query parameter
  - Modify get user so that it fetches the user's teams only if the query parameter `teams` is set in the request
    - note how `getTeams` method is generated by sequelize based on defined relationships
  2. Defining default scopes for model
  - in `User` model, exclude disabled users by default
  - also define `admin` scope
  - includ admin scope in sequelize query with `User.scope('admin').findAll()`
  3. Adding methods to sequelize models
  - add instance method `numberOfNotes`
  - add class method `with_notes`
  4. Repeatability of models and migrations
  - generating migration and model using sequelize command line tool

<details><summary>Part 9-b: First steps with TypeScript</summary>

- [Part 9-b: First steps with TypeScript](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part9/first_steps_with_type_script)

**_WE-WILL-LEARN:_**

**_LECTURE-VIDEO:_**

- [Setting up TypeScript tooling for Node project](https://youtu.be/4DMU8QNwREg)
  1. Manual setup
  - create folder
  - create npm project `npm init -y`
  - install libraries `npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript`
  - add script inside package.json
  2. Create our first TypeScript function, with plain JavaScript
  - create a file `multiplier.ts`
  - run it with `npm run ts-node -- multiplier.ts`
  3. Let's use TypeScript
  - give input types for function parameters
  4. Create custom type
  - create union type
  - see type suggestion
  - try using a not accepted argument
  5. Add return type
  6. Throw error when required
  - catch the error without putting any type
  - catch the error as `unknown`
    - then requires Type narrowing to access error.message
- [Putting TypeScript in Express server](https://youtu.be/e5l_FuOZtFo)
  1. Change `tsconfig.json`
  2. Configure script
  3. Create `index.ts` file
  4. Run it
  - change config to make it work
  - change back config
  5. Types for express
  - convert `require` to `import`
  - add required types to make code work
    - `npm install --save-dev @types/express`
  6. Other config related errors
  7. Install ts-node-dev
  - `npm install --save-dev ts-node-dev`
  - add package.json script
- [Add api endpoint for calculate](https://youtu.be/njfKRYLZ5_A)
  1. Add code for `/calculate` endpoint
  - export and import the `multiplicator` function
  - use it in the api
  2. Difference between explicit and implicit `any`
  3. Disallow explicit `any`
  - `npm install --save-dev eslint @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser`
  - configure `.eslintrc`
  - add script to `package.json`
  4. Setup more eslint rules
  - modify `.eslintrc`
  - fix the unsafe `any` issues
  - do some code level validation to sanitize data
  5. Using type assertion
  - import type `Operation`
  - use it to assert the `op` that is posted to `calculate` api
  - we can now remove the eslint warning, but this could cause runtime errors

- [Part 9-d: React with types](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part9/react_with_types)

**_WE-WILL-LEARN:_**

- TypeScript will help us catch the following errors:
  - trying to pass an extra/unwanted prop to a component
  - forgetting to pass a required prop to a component
  - passing a prop with the wrong type to a component
- Useful resources
  - [React TypeScript cheatsheet](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/)
  - [UseState generics detail](https://codewithstyle.info/Using-React-useState-hook-with-TypeScript/)

**_LECTURE-VIDEO:_**

- [Create React App with TypeScript](https://youtu.be/x1NuR5xOYtA)
  1. Create `my-app` with `create-react-app` using TypeScript template
  - `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript`
  2. Modify default app
  - in `tsconfig.json`, turn off `allowJs`
  - create `.eslintrc`
  - add script to run linting
  3. Examining a React component
  - delete all files inside `src` folder
  - delete all except `index.html` in `public` folder
  - create `index.tsx` in `src` folder
  - types are defined for component as in a regular function
  - we can remove the return type in component
  - type assertion for `document.getElementById`
- [Deeper type usage](https://youtu.be/LBYN0ED4zec)
  1. Create types
  - create file `types.ts` in `src` folder
  - add the required interfaces
  - create a union type
  - refactor the types
    - create a base
    - `extend` the base
  2. Use types in `App.tsx`
  - create `App.tsx`
    - import types
    - return null for now
    - export App
  - play around with `kind`
    - TypeScript implicitly narrows the type based on the `kind`
  3. Discriminated union - type narrowing of union type based on literal attribute
  - write jsx to show CourseParts
  - show name and exerciseCount
  - use ternary for type narrowing
  4. Exhaustive type checking to make sure all union types have been used
- [React app with state](https://youtu.be/SAIVWSU_LTQ)
  1. Create a new App-note.tsx
  - the first `useState` infers the type `string`
  - the second `useState` is not able to infer the type
    - lets explicitly put the type
  2. Add code to initialize some data, and show it in jsx
  3. Add function to create new note
  - put a form with controlled input
  - add `onSubmit` for the form
    - fix the type error for event
  4. Communicating with the server
  - start the json server from part6/redux-notes
  - install axios
  - get the initial notes from rest api
  - set the generics type for `axios.get` method
  5. Connect the add note to server
  6. A note about defining object types
  - interface vs type

<details><summary>Part 11-a: Introduction to CI/CD</summary>

- [Part 11-a: Introduction to CI/CD](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part11/introduction_to_ci_cd)

**_WE-WILL-LEARN:_**

- Software development life cycle
- Meaning of CI / CD

**_LECTURE-VIDEO:_**

- [Software journey from development to production](https://youtu.be/lur5tfxqJT4)
  1. Follow the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) for software development
  - create a feature branch
  - complete coding and testing the feature
  - create a `Pull request` to the main branch
    - another user checks the code, and merges to the main branch
  2. Build the application to make it ready for `deploying` to server
  3. `Deploy` the code to production
- [CI / CD](https://youtu.be/lur5tfxqJT4)
  1. CI: `Continuous Integration` refers to merging developer changes to the main branch. This involves:
  - `merging` feature branch to main branch
  - `lint`
  - `build`: e.g. build the frontend code and put it in static folder of backend repository
  - `test`: run all frontend/backend jest, cypress tests to make sure they pass
  - `package`: e.g. create a zip file of part3/notes-server with `ALL` required code files including `node_modules`
  - `deploy`: e.g. ftp the zip file to production server, unzip it, and restart the node server
  2. CD: could mean `Continuous Delivery` or `Continuous Deployment`
  - the practice where the main branch is kept deployable at all times
  - automated deployments triggered from merges into the main branch
  3. `Important principals`: The goal is better, faster software development with fewer preventable bugs and better team cooperation
  - How to make sure that tests run on all code that will be deployed?
  - How to make sure that the main branch is deployable at all times?
  - How to ensure that builds will be consistent and will always work on the platform it'd be deploying to?
  - How to make sure that the changes don't overwrite each other?
  - How to make deployments happen at the click of a button or automatically when one merges to the main branch?
  4. Types of CI Setup
  - Self hosted setup, e.g. Jenkins
  - Cloud based solution, e.g. GitHub Actions

  - **name**: identifier for the workflow
  - **on**: the [event that will trigger the workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows) to be executed
  - **jobs**: one or more `jobs` (series of steps) to be executed in the workflow
  5. commit & push
  6. check the `Actions` tab in GiHub to see the workflow
  7. add step to list the files
  - you can configure a GitHub action workflow to start once:
    - An event on GitHub occurs such as when someone pushes a commit to a repository or when an issue or pull request is created
    - A scheduled event, that is specified using the cron-syntax, happens
    - An external event occurs, for example, a command is performed in an external application such as Slack or Discord messaging app
- [Setting up lint, test and build steps](https://youtu.be/uWrCIJZc3T4)
  1. create new workflow file `pipeline.yml`
  2. add new workflow code
  3. create a job
  - setup environment to run the job
  - add step to checkout the code
  - add step to setup node
  - add step to run npm install (you can set working-directory if required)
  - add step to run linting (you can set working-directory if required)
  4. commit and push code

**_WE-WILL-LEARN:_**

- Put conditions for executing Github Actions
- Versioning git repositories

**_LECTURE-VIDEO:_**

- [Workflow in Pull Requests](https://youtu.be/Ibit4QxIF_c)
  1. keep the main branch green
  2. usage of pull requests
  - for code review
  - automate trigger of tasks in the CI pipeline
  3. configure GitHub action to trigger on PR
  - NOTE!! make sure your `PR` is from your feature branch to YOUR main branch
  4. put condition on `deploy` step to only execute on certain `github.event_name` condition
- [About versioning](https://youtu.be/vNb-0_FDa0A)
  1. types of versioning
  - semantic versioning: {major}.{minor}.{patch} (e.g. 1.2.23)
  - hash versioning: is the hash from the commit point
  2. ways to keep track of versions
  - something in the code itself (e.g. a file in the repo with version number)
  - something in the repo or repo metadata (e.g. `tags` or `releases` in git)
  - something completely outside the repo (e.g. a spreadsheet that lists the Semantic Version and the commit it points to)
  3. best versioning workflow:
  - CI system keeps track of development by hash versioning
  - once code is successfully merged to main branch, then CI system gives a semantic version
  4. use [anothrNick/github-tag-action](https://github.com/anothrNick/github-tag-action) for automating semantic versioning in GitHub Actions
  - put it in a separate job
  - use the `needs` keyword to make this job depend on the previous job, `simple_deployment_pipeline`
  - only run this job on PR merge
  - checkout the code in the first step
  - in the tag step
    - change the default bump to `patch`
    - add token for authentication in your repository, as the action is third-party which needs authentication
    - only run the step if the commit message does not contain `#skip`
- [Final notes](https://youtu.be/vNb-0_FDa0A?t=1083)
  1. when using third party actions, e.g. github-tag-action, it might be a good idea to specify the used version with hash instead of using a version number
  2. keep the main branch protected

**_WE-WILL-LEARN:_**

**_LECTURE-VIDEO:_**

- [Additional usage of CI pipelines](https://youtu.be/AOUNtGhznR4)
  1. use commit comments to automate bug tracking systems
  2. automate communications based on CI status
  3. steps to build discord success/failure notification to discord
  - use GitHub action [discord-webhook-notify](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/discord-webhook-notify) to send notification to [University of Helsinki discord channel - fullstack_webhook](https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/discord/join/fullstack) using [their webhook](https://discord.com/api/webhooks/905102634300637195/G6o7r15r3rO5PO7IFw0xaiJ79oYO0QttiXFU9Ab5hr_McBWZDXjJCoAJSkH4VRj3V3uC)
    - a success indication if a new version gets deployed
    - an error indication if a build fails
  4. **regarding metrics** - keep metrics of build time so that you can
  - project future build times
  - see if there are any sudden build time changes
  5. **periodic tasks** - automate with either commonly available tools, or, if not available, build automation yourself. you can schedule through GitHub Actions
  6. **building vs buying** - it's almost always better to use a tool that already does the job than to roll your own solution
  7. creating your own pipeline
  - create a new repo
  - includ phonebook server code into `server` folder
  - put phonebook frontend into `client` folder
  - make sure that `MONGODB_URI` env is entered into heroku `config vars`
  - make sure `HEROKU_API_KEY` is entered as github actions secret
  - make sure that the build script in `package.json` is named `build`
    - it should build to a folder that is referred from the backend's `express.static`
  8. protect your `main` branch
  - require a pull request. make sure approval is required
  - do not allow bypassing even for administrators

## WEEK 1

<details>
<summary><h3 style="display:inline">Days</h3></summary>
<details>
<summary>Day 1</summary>

**_WE-WILL-LEARN:_**

- Algorithms
  - Linear search
  - Binary search
  - Two crystal ball
  - Bubble sort
- REACTO
- Big O
- System design an ATM Machine

**_INTERVIEWING USING REACTO_**

- Read
  - ask clarifying questions
  - confirm your assumptions with the interviewer
- Example
  - write down example
    - one simple case
    - edge cases (many, if you can think of)
  - for arrays, always ask
    - is it sorted
    - can there be duplicates
- Analyze
  - tell your interviewer that you are going to analyze the simpe case first. think aloud to the interviewer as you are analyzing the simple case solution. let her hear all your thoughts; don't just analyze in your mind. come out with the solution that you are able to think of right away, don't try to be clever to come up with the optimal solution in the first go. it is ok if it is a naive solution
  - talk about the Big(O) of the solution
    - time complexity
    - space complexity
- Code it completely
- Test it using the simple example
  - then test for some of the edge cases, and see if you need to modify code for it
- Optimize solution if possible. but since you have done naive solution already, there isn't pressure to complete it

**_BIG O NOTATION_**

[Big O](https://theprimeagen.github.io/fem-algos/lessons/algorithms-and-time-space-complexity/time-and-space-complexity) is a way to categorize your algorithm's time or memory requirements based on input. It is not meant to be an exact measurement. It will not tell you how many CPU cycles it takes, instead it is meant to generalize the growth of your algorithm.

- Big O of time
  - O(N) - if there is one loop through the input
  - O(N^2) - if there is nested loop through the input
  - O(log N) - if the input is halved in each step
  - O(N log N) - if the input is halved in each step
- Big O of space
  - how much memory is the algorithm going to consume?
  - generally, not much focus will be put on this
  - it only comes into focus when using hashing function

### While calculating Big O

1. look for loops!
1. growth is with respect to the input
1. constants are dropped
1. worst case is usually the way we measure

**_WEB APP DESIGN_**

1. requirements, user stories

- As a `<persona>`, I want to `<do something>` so that `<reason>`
  - example: as a `phonebook owner`, I want to see all of my contacts, so that I can see their phone number

2. implementation detail

- How you will actually fulfill a user story
- Split each story into specific, bite-size tasks (implementation detail)
  - Should always serve a user story
- examples:
  - an Express route on the backend
    (GET `/api/contacts`) should serve up the name,
    phone number of all the contacts from our Postgres database. access should be restricted to only the owner of the contact.
  - a React component on the frontend should call `/api/contacts` on first load, save it on redux, and use contacts from redux to display them on the screen

3. models

- list all the different models you will need, e.g. `users`, `contacts`
- write down all the fields for the models
- draw connections between models, e.g. one-to-one, one-to-many etc

4. wireframes

- rough mockups for all the frontend screens

**_TO-DO:_**

- REACTO interview problems
- Web app design for Blogslist
