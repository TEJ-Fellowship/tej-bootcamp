## Presentation

Date: Monday, December 18

- 3 minute presentation (zoom)
- live demo of what you built
- Elevator Pitch: A minute long description of your project
- Take your elevator pitch and expand on it with
  - Technologies you’ve used (your tech stack)
  - Challenges you’ve faced/Hardest challenge
  - Why you chose that project/What interested you in the tech

## What are you building

### Rules

- No requirements
- Self-assigned idea
- Should be ambitious

### Build something cool: think outside the box

- LLM projects using huggingface, langchain, chatGpt etc.
  - e.g. a chatbot for a specific industry (e.g. healthcare)
- NPM modules / frontend libraries
- Experimental/Emerging technologies
  - Blockchain, Augmented Reality, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Games
- Chrome extensions
- Desktop apps (electron), mobile apps (React Native, Flutter)
- Other technologies/languages/concepts
  - Firebase, Redis, Elixir (Phoenix Framework), Elm, Vue, GraphQL, etc...
- You are equipped to build more than just “websites”
  - if building a 'website', make it a PWA
- Be creative

### Areas of focus

- Explore a new technology
  - Libraries, tools, APIs
- Build something useful/interesting for yourself
  - Use your background!
- Focus on the wow factor

### MVP

- As in Minimum Viable Product
- Come up with whatever crazy, huge idea you want
- ...Then think of ONE use case
- And build for that ONLY

### And just in case

- Something may go wrong so have a backup
- Maybe you don’t get to finish what you want to finish
- This is all okay because this is meant to be ambitious but you must present
- Presentation describing:
  - What you were trying to do?
  - What did you learn?
  - What advice do you have for other developers trying to pursue this topic/project?
