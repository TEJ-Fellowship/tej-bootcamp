### 1. setup

1. resets
2. globals
3. colors
4. fonts
5. constants
6. break-points

### 2. process

1. divide row-wise `<div>`s
1. divide from big to small components
1. decide where to use `flex-box` vs `grid` vs `block` vs `inline` vs `inline-block` display elements (and what are the defaults for elements)
1. start from the big components
1. design the smaller components independently, without worrying how they will fit into the bigger picture

### 3. tricks

1. define different behavior based on break-points using classes
