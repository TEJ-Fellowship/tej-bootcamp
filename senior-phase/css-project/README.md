# CSS Projects

## Lets build https://fullstackopen.com/en/

### 1. setup

1. resets
2. globals
3. colors
4. fonts
5. constants (tokens)
6. break-points

note: you can get started with the `css-presets` branch to get a starter stylesheet with resets, globals, tokens and break-points

### 2. process

1. divide row-wise `<div>`s
1. divide from big to small components
1. decide where to use `flex-box` vs `grid` vs `block` vs `inline` vs `inline-block` display elements (and what are the defaults for elements)
1. start from the big components
1. design the smaller components independently, without worrying how they will fit into the bigger picture

### 3. tricks

1. define different behavior based on break-points using classes
